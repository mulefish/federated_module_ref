# repo
https://github.com/mulefish/federated_module_ref

# set up
Two sibling directories 'federated-host' and 'federated-module'
The trick? npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server --save-dev
in both. And pay attention to the webpack.config.js. And run both. 

# browser
http://localhost:3001/


# In two different terminals: 
cd federated-host
npm start 

cd federated-module
npm start 

Browser: http://localhost:3001/
